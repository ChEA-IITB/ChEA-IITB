At first, as most of the guys I was not sure about what should I choose but after few rounds of discussion with my seniors, I wanted to go for either university intern or some core intern and as it turns out, I am here, working in one of the biggest steel manufacturing companies in the world. The selection procedure was same as for most of the firms. We had an online exam prior to the ..</p>

                            <p>Hi, I am Moin, a dual degree student in Chemical Engineering, now entering my fourth year. I would like to share my internship experience at Mechanobiology Institute, National University of Singapore. The research which I did here has got very little to do with traditional Chemical Engineering, but biology as a subject has been amalgamating quickly with Chemical Engineering, and has opened up many new avenues for research..</p>

2. Getting there
It started with apping. I was amongst the lucky ones, I only had to send around 40 emails before getting an affirmative reply..</p>

You can see countless posters with the scores against their arch-rival, the Ohio State University, depicting their pride and madness for college sports. I am halfway through my intern along with 3 students from IITB. University of Michigan was the first university to offer interns through Placement Cell in this year’s internship season.</p>
